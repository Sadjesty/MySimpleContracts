/*The point is that a person creates a contract to make a bet. He becomes the owner of that contract. 

He is the only person who is able to add events to the contract using createEvent method where the name of a certain event is entered. The method also comes with unique ID to make an interaction with an event more convenient. 

After creating an event, you can make a bet. Ether winning or losing (50/50). To make calculations easier only 1 Ether can be bet. 

After this, the contractâ€™s owner only is able to use setResult method to calculate the result. 

However there is a checking, whether bets on any result are made or not. 

If the check is successful, no more bets can be made. 

To calculate the result pseudo-function 50/50 is used by chance. The result is set in the game. 

Then the players can check the result of the event (game). And, if their guesses are right, they can withdraw the winnings to their  accounts. */
